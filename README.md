# MINOR MINERS

In this game, you assume the role of an occupational health and safety inspector task with assessing a lithium mine staffed by child laborers, ensuring that their fire alarms comply with safety standards. 
However, things take a drastic turn when a gas leak induces hallucinations, leading you to believe you're trapped in a cave overrun with goblins.

_(Wait... wasn't there just a bunch of kids here?)_

Armed with a clipboard, an array of talking tools _(talking..?-)_, and a can-do attitude, your objective is to battle through swarms of goblins to reach the surface.
_
(Seriously though, what happened to the ki-)_

**You're a man on a mission, and you won't let any goblin stand in your way.**
